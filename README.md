## Overview

### What is it

Once started, game offers a choice to either start it or load it. Once started you get your stats (health, strength, brains, money and XP). With them, you can start the fight against the random enemy with random stats, you can save the game (i.e. save current stats to load them later) or you can go to shop to buy more health, more strength or more XP in exchange for money.

The fight itself is automatic where hits are getting thrown both on the player and the enemy, diminishing health of the both and the first one to lose all health will lose. In case of a win, you'll get rewarded.
